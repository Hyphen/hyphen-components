# SelectInputNative

Allows users to pick a value from a predefined list of options. Ideally, it should be used when there are 5 or more options, otherwise you should consider using a radio group instead.

_NOTE:_ This is an alternative to the `SelectInput` component, but leveraging the native platform dropdown instead of a custom one. This is useful,
when a custom UI is not needed for a select, or the native UI is preferred (this is recommended for most cases except multi-selects).

## Props

<ArgTypes of={SelectInputNative} />

## Default

All that is required to render a basic version of the SelectInputNative is a unique `id`, a `label`, a list of options passed to the `options` prop, a `value`, and an onchange event handler passed to the `onChange` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

## Pre-Selected

Pre-select an option by passing its value to the `value` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.PreSelected} />

## Help Text

Use the `helpText` prop to add clarifying text beneath the input label.

<Canvas of={Stories.HelpText} />

## Placeholder

Use the `placeholder` prop to add a custom placeholder. Note that this component automatically renders the first option
to use as a placeholder with a value of `''`. This first option is however disabled can't be selected after a user has picked
one of the real options.

<Canvas of={Stories.Placeholder} />

## Hidden Label

Use the `hideLabel` prop to not render the label.

<Canvas of={Stories.HiddenLabel} />

## Autofocus

Use the `autoFocus` prop to autofocus a SelectInput.

<Canvas of={Stories.Autofocus} />

## Required

Use the `isRequired` prop to set the `required` and `aria-required` on the underlying input element.

<Canvas of={Stories.Required} />

You can remove or customize the required indicator using the `requiredIndicator` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomRequiredIndicator} />

## Disabled

Use the `isDisabled` prop to mark the input as disabled.

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Error

Use the `error` prop to mark the input as invalid. `error` accepts a `boolean`, `string`, or `node`. If either a `string` or `node` is passed, a validation message is displayed below it.

<Canvas of={Stories.Error} />

## Sizes

Set the size of the input to `sm`, `md` or `lg`. `md` is the default size.
The `size` prop is also a `ResponsiveProp`, so it can be sized differently at each [breakpoint](?path=/docs/design-tokens-design-tokens--page#breakpoints) by passing an object.

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

## Component Design Tokens

This component shares component design tokens with all form controls. For a complete list of tokens, see the [Theming Form Controls documentation](/docs/theming-form-controls--custom-theme-form).
