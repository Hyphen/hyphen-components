# Formik Form

Formik Form demonstrates a pattern for integrating the input elements found in Hyphen Components with [Formik](https://formik.org/). The form is fully functional and even mock submits. Manipulate the inputs in the form and watch the state object below it update with the new values in real-time. Attempt to submit the form without filling out required inputs, and observe the error states for these inputs.
