# FormLabel

FormLabel is a sub component of many of our inputs, and is meant to be paired with a form input. In most cases, the label will have already been built into another component as a prop. However, you can use it on its own or with another component.

## Accessibility

- Each label requires the `inputId` prop that equals the id of the associated input so that the `htmlFor` property can be set.
- Don't use placeholder text as a replacement for labels. It can be used to provide an example to users, but will disappear from the field when a user enters text. It's also not broadly supported by assistive technologies and won't display in older browsers.
- Use one of 3 ways to label a form field in order of most preferred:
  1. Visible label with Label
  2. Visible label that's associated to the input with aria-labelledby
  3. Label directly using aria-label
