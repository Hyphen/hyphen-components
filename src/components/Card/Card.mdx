# Card

A card is a stylized Box component that acts as a container to group related information and actions.
It consists of three child components that are automatically included with the `<Card />`:

1. `<Card.Header />` - should contain a descriptive title for the Card's contents
1. `<Card.Section />` - for the body of the card, and can consists of many sections
1. `<Card.Footer />` - a place for primary actions for the card's contents

## Props

## Default Card

A `<Card />` consists of three child components:
