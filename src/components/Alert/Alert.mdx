# Overview

Use alerts to display feedback for users about specific actions, or states of an application.

<Canvas of={Stories.Overview} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Alert} />

## Variants

Alerts come in different variants based on the kind of feedback being delivered to the user. Additionally, a combination of icon, title, and message can be used depending on your content needs.

<Canvas of={Stories.Variants} />

## Closable

The alert can be made closable by passing the `isClosable` prop. Note that this only controls the presence of
the close icon, but closing actually happens programmatically with a callback passed to the `onClose` prop.
If you need custom close text, pass it in the `closeText` prop.
