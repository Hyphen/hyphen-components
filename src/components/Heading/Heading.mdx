# Heading

Use `Headings` as labels for pages or sections of a page that make up an interface. `Headings` can label an entire page, or sections of related content.
The `Heading` component allows you to specify an appropriate semantic element (h1-h6) and independently set its size so that it is appropriate for the surrounding content.
If no size is specified, a default size will be applied.

<Canvas of={Stories.AllLevels} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Heading} />

## Sizes

The default size of the Heading can overridden as so that it's appropriate for its surrounding context.

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

The `size` prop accepts an object where the properties correspond to [breakpoint tokens](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#breakpoints).

<Canvas of={Stories.ResponsiveSizes} />

## Colors

The variant of the heading is inherited from its parent, but can be set to brand variant as well.

<Canvas of={Stories.Colors} />
