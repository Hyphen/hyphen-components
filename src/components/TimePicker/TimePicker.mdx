# TimePicker

Use a TimePicker when you want users to select from a list of a available times agnostic of date.

_NOTE:_ This component is abstracted from the [SelectInput](?path=/docs/components-selectinput-overview--default-story)
and as such includes the same underlying props interface with an added method for generating the time options automatically.

_ABOUT TIME FORMAT:_ While the `value` prop technically returns `{ label: string; value: string; }` the value returned will always
be a JS ISO date string, like this: `2016-07-13T18:46:01.933Z`.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={TimePicker} />

## Default

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

## With A Specific Interval

Pass an `interval` (seconds) value to determine how many times get generated as options.
The example below uses `3600` --> 1 Hour Intervals

<Canvas of={Stories.WithASpecificInterval} />

## With Min and Max Times

You can determine the range of times to be shown by capping the start and end times.
Use `startTime` and `endTime` for this. The expected values for `hour` and `minute` properties
are `0-24` and `0-60` respectively.

IMPORTANT: `startTime` is inclusive, and `endTime` is exclusive. This is to avoid
the options showing the startTime twice when using a 24-hour cycle.

See example below where we want to show 15 minute increments starting at 9:00AM and ending at 3:30PM.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithMinAndMaxTimes} />

## With Custom Date Display

The labels for the dropdwon options are governed by JS `toLocaleTimeString`, and as such
options are available to customize these.

NOTE: that the option values are always returned as ISO strings regardless of the label display option.

The example below is shown in military (24-hour) time.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithCustomDateDisplay} />

## With Open Menu

The menu can be rendered open with the `menuIsOpen` prop. We do this here to confirm option generation
via our UI visual snapshot testing (Chromatic).

<Canvas of={Stories.WithOpenMenu} />

## Help Text

<Canvas of={Stories.HelpText} />

## Sizes

Set the size of the input to `sm`, `md` or `lg`. `md` is the default size.

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

## Component Design Tokens

This component shares component design tokens with all form controls. For a complete list of tokens, see the [Theming Form Controls documentation](/docs/theming-form-controls--custom-theme-form).
