# Overview

A `<Box>` is a layout component to build UIs with consistent padding and spacing between elements.

- Its content is arranged in a specified `direction`, with 'column' being the default
- Renders a `<div />` element by default, but can be changed using `as`
- Allows you to specify the spacing between child elements using `gap`
- Many props accept `ResponsiveProp` that take an object with keys that correspond to [breakpoint tokens](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#breakpoints).

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Box} />

## Background Color

Use the `background` prop to set the color of the background

<Canvas of={Stories.Background} />

## Border

Use the `borderColor` prop to set the color of the border and the borderWidth to set the width. `borderWidth` also accepts css shorthand values that correspond to top, right, bottom, left.

<Canvas of={Stories.Border} />

## Gap

Use `gap` to set the spacing between children of a Box (for display grid and flex).

Use `rowGap` and `columnGap` to set the spacing between children of a Box (for display grid and flex) in the row and column directions independently. You can also use shorthand `gap` to set both at once (e.g. `gap="row col"`).

<Canvas of={Stories.Gap} />

### Child Gap

For block layouts, you can use `childGap` to set the spacing between children of a Box. For flex or grid layouts, use `gap` instead.

<Canvas of={Stories.ChildGap} />

## Flex Properties

### Flex

The most common use case is to set children of a `<Box />` to `flex="auto"`.
The item is sized according to its width and height properties, but grows to absorb any extra free space in the parent, and shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container.
This is equivalent to setting "flex: 1 1 auto".

If you need more granular flex control for properties such as `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`, we recommend
passing using a standard `style` object with the `flex` shorthand you need.

<Canvas of={Stories.FlexAuto} />

### Flex Direction

Set direction of child elements in a flex container.

<Canvas of={Stories.FlexDirection} />

<Canvas of={Stories.FlexShrinkGrow} />

### Justify Content

Set content alignment along the main axis

<Canvas of={Stories.FlexJustify} />

### Align Items

Set content alignment along the cross axis.

<Canvas of={Stories.FlexAlign} />

### Align Content

Set the Box's lines within where there is extra space in the cross-axis.
This property has no effect when there is only one line of flex items.

<Canvas of={Stories.FlexAlignContent} />

## Font Color

Use the `color` prop to set the color of the text

<Canvas of={Stories.FontColor} />

## Font Size

Set the `fontSize` prop with a [font size](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#font-size) token to set the size of the text in the Box.

<Canvas of={Stories.FontSizes} />

### Font Family

<Canvas of={Stories.FontFamily} />

## Font Weight

Set the `fontWeight` prop with a [font weight](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#font-weight) token to set the size of the text in the Box.

<Canvas of={Stories.FontWeights} />

## Text Align

Set the `textAlign` prop to set the alignment of the text in the Box.

<Canvas of={Stories.TextAlign} />

## Margin

The `margin` prop accepts a single [spacing](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#spacing) value or a set of spacing values that correspond with css shorthand syntax. Margin values can be set on the horizontal or vertical axis, or the top, right, bottom and left sides of a Box.

<Canvas of={Stories.Margin} />

## Padding

The `padding` prop accepts a single [spacing](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#spacing) value or a set of spacing values that correspond with css shorthand syntax. Padding values can be set on the horizontal or vertical axis, or the top, right, bottom and left sides of a Box.

<Canvas of={Stories.Padding} />

## Radius

Set the `radius` prop with a [radius token](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#border-radius) to set the corner radius of the box.

<Canvas of={Stories.Radius} />

## Shadow

Set the `shadow` prop with a [shadow token](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#box-shadow) to set the outer shadow of the box.

<Canvas of={Stories.Shadow} />

## Width

Width can be set to any CSS unit value (px, rem, em, %).

<Canvas of={Stories.Width} />

[Width tokens](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#width) may be used to set widths as well.

<Canvas of={Stories.WidthTokens} />

Set the width to a common percentage of the Box's parent.

<Canvas of={Stories.WidthPercentages} />

## Height

Height can be set to any CSS unit value (px, rem, em, %).

<Canvas of={Stories.Height} />

[Height tokens](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#height) may be used to set height as well.

<Canvas of={Stories.HeightTokens} />

Set the height to a common percentage of the Box's parent.

<Canvas of={Stories.HeightPercentages} />

## Overflow

Set the overflow behavior of the Box with `overflow`

<Canvas of={Stories.Overflow} />

## Cursor

Set the cursor for value for the element in question. Use any valid [CSS cursor value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor#values).

<Canvas of={Stories.Cursor} />

## Position

Set the CSS position for the element in question. Use any valid [CSS position value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#values) or a
responsive object prop with said values. Example with `fixed` position not included. Scroll the container to see these in action.

<Canvas of={Stories.Position} />

## Hover States

You can control the styles for the box on hover using the `hover` prop and passing token values for the relevant property.
Hover on the elements below to see these in action.

Currently our library supports hover states for:

- `background`
- `borderColor`
- `borderWidth`
- `color`
- `fontSize`
- `shadow`

<Canvas of={Stories.Hover} />

## Focus States

You can control the styles for the box on hover using the `focus` prop and passing token values for the relevant property.
Focus on the elements below to the these in action.

Currently our library supports hover states for:

- `background`
- `borderColor`
- `borderWidth`
- `color`
- `shadow`

<Canvas of={Stories.Focus} />

## Responsive Props

Any props that accept a `ResponsiveProp` will take an object with the following shape:

```
{
  base?: prop, // breakpoint starting at 0 pixels, not scoped by media query.
  tablet?: prop, // 608px and higher.
  desktop?: prop, // 992px and higher.
  hd?: prop, // 1280px and higher.
}
```

These props will create classes that are scoped to the specific breakpoint they are assigned to. Not all breakpoints
are required in this shape, you can pick and choose which breakpoints require different layout attributes based on a
mobile first approach.

Props that are responsive-enabled follow a mobile-first approach, which means that styles are applied first to smaller viewports (i.e. mobile devices).
As the viewport size increases, new styles may be applied (styles are overridden for larger viewports).
Responsive enabled props take a keyed object that specifies at which [breakpoints](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs#breakpoints) to apply certain properties.

```
<Box
  width={{
    base: '100px' // box width is 100px
    tablet: '200px' // box width is 200px when viewport width is greater than size-breakpoint-tablet
    desktop: '300px' // box width is 600px when viewport width is greater than size-breakpoint-desktop
    hd: '600px' // box width is 600px when viewport width is greater than size-breakpoint-hd
  }}
>
```

Try resizing the browser to see the responsive properties in action.

#### Omitting Keys

When passing an object, omitting a key is the same as not applying any styles.
For example the following has padding at the `desktop` breakpoint and wider.

<Canvas of={Stories.Omit} />
