# Button

Buttons are used as triggers for actions.
They are used in forms, toolbars, modal dialogs and as stand-alone action triggers.
Actions almost always occur on the same page.

<Canvas isExpanded of={Stories.Default} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Button} />

## Variants

The `variant` prop determines which color visual weight to render.

<Canvas of={Stories.Variants} />

## Sizes

Set the size of the button to `xs`, `sm`, `md` or `lg`. `md` is the default size. The button also takes a `ResponsiveProp` object
so it can have different sizes at different breakpoints.

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

## Full Width

Use the `fullWidth` prop to allow the button to grow to its container's full width.

<Canvas of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## Icons

Add an icon to the left or right inside the Button using the `iconPrefix` and `iconSuffix` props respectively.

<Canvas of={Stories.Icons} />

## Icon Button

Use a combination of `tertiary-*` variant and a named icon to make an icon a button. Be sure to include an `aria-label` for screen readers to know what action the button will perform when pressed.

<Canvas of={Stories.IconButton} />

## Loading

Setting the `isLoading` prop to true will replace the button text with loading indicator and disable the button to prevent unintended submissions.
The width of the button will remain consistent to prevent content from shifting.

<Canvas of={Stories.Loading} />

## Disabled

Use for actions that arenâ€™t currently available, such as immediately after a form submission.
The interface should make it clear why the button is disabled and what needs to be done to enable it.

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Event Callbacks

Callback functions can be passed to `onClick`, `onBlur`, and `onFocus` events.

<Canvas of={Stories.EventCallbacks} />

## As an Anchor

You can render an anchor tag with the style of a button by using the `as` prop. You
can render buttons as one of `button`, `a`, and `input`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Anchor} />
