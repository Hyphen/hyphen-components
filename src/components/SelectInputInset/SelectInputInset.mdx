# SelectInputInset

Use `SelectInputInset` to create a floating label input field, but unlike `TextInputInset` they always show the `label` in the floated state. It is a controlled component, which means that you need to provide a value and an `onChange` handler to update the value.

<Canvas withSource="open" of={Stories.Default} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={SelectInputInset} />

### Required

Use the `isRequired` prop to display an `*` after the label and set the `required` and `aria-required` on the underlying input element. You can also use the `requiredIndicator` prop to customize the indicator that appears next to the label.

<Canvas of={Stories.Required} />

### Help Text

Use `helpText` to provide additional information about the input field.

<Canvas of={Stories.HelpText} />

### Validation Error

Use the `error` prop to mark the input as invalid. `error` accepts a `boolean`, `string`, or `node`.

<Canvas of={Stories.ValidationError} />

### Disabled

Add `isDisabled`to give it a grayed out appearance, remove pointer events, and prevent focusing.

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

### Clearable

Use the `onClear` prop to display a clear icon (x) when the input has a value. `onClear` will fire
a callback function when the clear icon is clicked, which can then be handled to clear the value.

<Canvas of={Stories.Clearable} />

### Sizes

Two sizes, `md` and `lg` are available, with `md` being the default.

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />
