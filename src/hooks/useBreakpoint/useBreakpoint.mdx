# useBreakpoint

The `useBreakpoint` returns useful states based on the window innerWidth and hyphen-component [breakpoints]().

The hook will return a `BreakpointState` object with the following shape:

```
{
  isPhone: boolean,
  isTablet: boolean,
  isDesktop: boolean,
  isHd: boolean,
  activeBreakpoint: { name: BreakpointName, minWidth: number },
}
```

**NOTE:** This hook relies on `ResponsiveContext`, so your app must be wrapped in the [`ResponsiveProvider`]() to provide window size context to all children components.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas isExpanded of={Stories.BasicUsage} />
